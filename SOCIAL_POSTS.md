Show HN: ControllerKeys – System-wide controller-to-keyboard mapping for macOS
```

**Body:**

I built this because I wanted to "vibe code" from my couch with an Xbox controller and all my regular keyboard shortcuts.

Existing options fell short: Joystick Mapper hasn't been updated in years, Enjoyable was abandoned in 2014, Controlly lacks chord mappings and an on-screen keyboard, and Steam's controller mapping only works in games – not system-wide.

**Key features:**

- Map any button to keyboard shortcuts, modifiers, or combos
- Chord mappings (press multiple buttons → one action)
- Long-hold and double-tap for alternate actions
- Left stick → mouse, right stick → scroll
- **Precision mode**: hold a trigger (RT by default) for fine mouse control – makes pixel-accurate clicking easy
- **Full DualSense touchpad support**: tap, two-finger scroll, pinch-to-zoom with native macOS gestures
- DualSense LED customization and mic support (USB)
- Profile system for different workflows

**On-screen keyboard widget:**

This is more than just a keyboard – it's a mini command center you can trigger with any button:

- Full keyboard for typing without a physical keyboard
- **App launcher**: show/hide your favorite apps with one click
- **Bookmark bar**: websites display with favicon and title, open in default browser
- **Quick commands**: type text snippets or run terminal commands instantly
- Variable expansion: insert date/time, clipboard contents, current app name, etc.

The killer combo: pair this with whisper-based voice transcription (I use VoiceInk) and you have full computer control from a controller. No keyboard needed.

Using voice transcription, the on-screen keyboard widget is really more of a tool for easily jumping around apps and executing commands on your computer.

**Technical notes:**

- Native Swift/SwiftUI, Apple Silicon optimized
- Uses CGEvent API for input simulation (requires Accessibility permission)
- No network access, no data collection – source is open for security audit
- Signed and notarized by Apple

The app is $10 on Gumroad. Source is available on GitHub for transparency since it requires Accessibility permissions, but I'd appreciate purchases to support continued development.

```
I wanted to vibe code from my couch. So I built ControllerKeys for macOS.

Map any controller button to keyboard shortcuts, system-wide. Here's how it works 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
Every button becomes a shortcut:
- D-pad → arrow keys
- Triggers → modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl)
- Bumpers → Cmd, Option
- Chord multiple buttons → complex shortcuts
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Mouse control that actually works:
- Left stick → cursor
- Right stick → scroll
- Hold RT → precision mode for pixel-accurate clicks
- DualSense touchpad → tap, scroll, pinch-to-zoom
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
The on-screen keyboard widget is the secret weapon.

One button opens: app launcher, bookmark bar, quick commands, full keyboard.

Jump between apps. Open URLs. Run terminal commands. All from the controller.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Add voice transcription (I use @VoiceInkApp) and you've got full computer control without touching a keyboard.

couch coding setup:
- xbox controller
- voice transcription
- mass produced 65 inch screen from costco

the mass produced 65 inch screen was already there. i just had to build an app that lets me use all my shortcuts from a controller.

the year is 2026. i mass produce software from my couch using only a ps5 controller and my voice. my mass produced software enables me to mass produce more software from my couch.

"just use a keyboard"

the keyboard is 6 feet away. i am mass producing vibes. i will not be moving.
```

```
engineer brain: what if i mass produced a mass produced app so i could mass produce apps from mass produced furniture
```

```
stages of couch coding:

1. voice transcription for typing
2. realize you still need a mouse
3. build an entire app so your xbox controller becomes a mouse
4. realize you need shortcuts
5. the app now has chord mappings
6. add an on-screen keyboard
7. add an app launcher
8. add a bookmark bar
9. you mass produced a whole product
```

```
the real mass production was the apps we mass produced along the way

Hey r/macapps!

I built this app because I wanted to use my Mac from the couch with an Xbox controller. Existing tools were either abandoned (Enjoyable, Joystick Mapper) or only work in games (Steam).

**What it does:**

- Map any controller button to keyboard shortcuts (with modifier support)
- Chord mappings – press multiple buttons for one shortcut
- Left stick → mouse, right stick → scroll
- Precision mode (hold RT) for fine cursor control
- Full DualSense touchpad support: tap, two-finger scroll, pinch-to-zoom
- On-screen keyboard widget with app launcher, bookmarks, and quick commands
- Profile system for different setups

**Why I built it:**

I've been using voice transcription for coding and wanted a way to control everything else without reaching for a keyboard. This + VoiceInk = full computer control from the couch.

**Transparency:**

The app requires Accessibility permissions (for input simulation), so the source is available on GitHub if you want to audit it. Native Swift/SwiftUI, no network access, signed and notarized.

Wanted to use my Mac from the couch without a keyboard. Built an app that turns game controllers into a full input device.

Features:
- Any button → keyboard shortcut
- Chord mappings (multiple buttons = one action)
- Joystick mouse control with precision mode
- DualSense touchpad works as a real trackpad (tap, scroll, pinch-to-zoom)
- On-screen widget: app launcher, bookmarks, commands, full keyboard

Pair it with voice transcription and you don't need a physical keyboard at all.

I wanted to "vibe code" – use my Mac from the couch with voice transcription. But I still needed a mouse and keyboard shortcuts.

So I built ControllerKeys:

- Map controller buttons to any keyboard shortcut
- Joystick becomes mouse (with precision mode for accurate clicks)
- DualSense touchpad works with tap, scroll, pinch-to-zoom
- On-screen keyboard widget with app launcher, bookmarks, and terminal commands

Now my workflow is: Xbox controller + voice transcription + 65" TV. No keyboard needed.

The irony of mass producing an entire app just to avoid walking 6 feet to my desk is not lost on me.

Update: ControllerKeys now supports PS5 DualSense touchpad, on-screen keyboard widget, and more – still vibe coding from my couch
```

**Flair:** Built with Claude

**Body:**
```
Some of you might remember my post from a couple months ago – I built an app to vibe code from my couch with an Xbox controller.

Well, I've been vibe coding with Claude ever since, and the app has grown quite a bit. Here's what's new:

**DualSense (PS5) Controller Support**
- Full touchpad support – tap to click, two-finger scroll, pinch-to-zoom
- It actually works like a real trackpad now
- LED color customization and mic support over USB

**On-Screen Keyboard Widget**
- Trigger it with any button
- Full keyboard for typing
- App launcher – switch apps with one click
- Bookmark bar – websites with favicons, click to open
- Quick commands – type text or run terminal commands instantly

**The setup now:**

Xbox/PS5 controller + voice transcription (I use VoiceInk) = full computer control from the couch. No keyboard needed.

The on-screen widget is really more of a command center at this point – jumping between apps, opening bookmarks, running git commands, all without leaving the couch.

Still open source, still built with Claude Code. The touchpad gesture recognition was a fun one to figure out with Claude – Apple's GameController framework only gives you single-touch, so we had to parse raw HID reports to get two-finger gestures working.

### r/swift (if focusing on technical angle)

```
Open source SwiftUI app: Xbox/DualSense controller → keyboard/mouse mapping for macOS
```

**Body:**
```
Sharing a project I've been working on – a native macOS app that maps game controller input to keyboard shortcuts and mouse control.

**Technical highlights:**

- SwiftUI with AppKit interop for menu bar
- GameController.framework for Xbox/DualSense input
- CGEvent API for keyboard/mouse simulation
- CoreBluetooth for DualSense LED control over Bluetooth
- HID reports for DualSense touchpad multi-touch parsing

The DualSense touchpad implementation was interesting – Apple's GameController framework only exposes single-touch, so I had to read raw HID reports to get two-finger gestures working (pinch-to-zoom, two-finger scroll).

Source is available since the app requires Accessibility permissions and I wanted it to be auditable.

Happy to discuss the implementation if anyone's curious about GameController framework or CGEvent.

**Maker Comment:**

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built ControllerKeys because I wanted to "vibe code" from my couch – using voice transcription for typing and a controller for everything else.

The existing options were either abandoned (Enjoyable hasn't been updated since 2014, Joystick Mapper is years out of date) or only work within games (Steam). Nothing worked system-wide with the features I needed.

The DualSense touchpad support was a fun challenge – Apple's GameController framework only exposes single-finger touch, so I had to parse raw HID reports to get two-finger gestures working (pinch-to-zoom, two-finger scroll).

The on-screen keyboard widget evolved from "I need to type sometimes" into a full command center – I use it more for launching apps and running terminal commands than actual typing now.

Happy to answer any questions about the implementation or use cases!

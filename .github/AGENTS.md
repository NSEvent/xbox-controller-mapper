4. **Quick Commands** - Trigger terminal commands or text snippets with button presses

5. **Chord Mappings** - Combine multiple buttons for single actions (e.g., LB+A = Save)

6. **Open Source** - Full source code available for security auditing (important since it requires Accessibility permissions)
